# On the Road

It's a fascinating journey, and there are ups and downs along the way. Anyway, here comes some milestones worth to be recorded. 

## caveman period

"In-ter-ne-t", a sound that repeatedly resonates in my head from my IT teacher during my junior high school. I had no idea what this means especially when it comes with a Chinese translation of four characters.

We were in front of a giant monster on the desktop, with big black screen but not knowing what to do with it. 

## system installations

Time flies. College life starts. Without any progress, or efforts, from my side, the computer science industry grew much faster than people's imagination. 

With "proficiency" in office softwares, the ever-searching mind started to turn its attention to system installations, first Windows, then Linux distributions (Fedora, SUSE etc.). 

## almost there !

So, there was National Computer Level Examinations. And Level 2 was about Foxpro, a database management software. It only took me a weekend's time for practice to pass. This encouraged my journey to Level 3, programming in C language.

The journey stopped when the most recommended textbook was all Greek to me.

Looking back, the Chinese textbook for C programming was not that awful. But it was, especially for an English major who would probably be able to read and understand the key concepts about programming.

## silent years

Make a living, but kept an eye on technology.

## journey re-started

2016, this repo was part of the journey.

## make a living again

When people asked, "how could you be wealthier one day, and be in debt another?", well, this happens.

This time, except making a living, some skills for project management,  product development were enhanced or added to the portfolio.
